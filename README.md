# Fibler - ARM64 Disassembler

A disassembler for ARM64 binaries with an intuitive GUI interface built using PyQt5. This tool helps analyze and modify ARM64 executables with features focused on binary analysis and modification.

## Features

âœ… **Current Features**
- GUI interface for easy binary navigation
- Mach-O/ELF ARM64 format support
- VirusTotal API integration (AV reports)
- Comment system for annotations

ðŸš§ **Upcoming Features**
- CLI flag (-fe) to search for exports effortlessly
- Virtual address instruction lookup
- Binary modification and rebuilding capabilities
- Instruction modification through context menu
- and more...

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/figtools/fibler.git
cd fibler
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Create an account on VirusTotal and get your API Key (free 500 lookups/day).

2. Create a .env file inside the project directory with your API Key: ```echo "VT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env```
    > Yes, there're better ways to handle the API key but, since it's free, I will change it in the future.

3. Run the main application:
```bash
python fibler.py
```

## Memory Management

When running the application, you may notice nanobind reporting leaked instances of LIEF's type system:
```
nanobind: leaked X instances!
 - leaked instance of type "lief._lief.VA_TYPES"
 - leaked instance of type "lief._lief.FORMATS"
```

These messages are **expected behavior** and can be safely ignored. They represent LIEF's static type system initialization, which:
- Are one-time allocations that don't grow with usage
- Get automatically cleaned up when Python exits
- Are required for Python-C++ interoperability

These are not memory leaks in your binary analysis workflow and won't affect the application's performance or memory usage over time.
